# 2bam WebGl logo

This project was done in a couple of weeks or so to replace my old webpage header and showcase some skills

- TypeScript 
- Vanilla WebGL
- Webpack
- A bit of algebra
- No library dependencies besides vector/matrix math
- Github Actions to build and deploy to its own Github Page
- Some of this paradigm, some of that
