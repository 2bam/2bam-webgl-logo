# Nice to have

Life's too short for perfection

[ ] Make closest actor pick up the debris (See if it still looks good and chaotic and not _too ordered_)
[ ] Some rats make a placement mistake and afterwards repair that mistake
[ ] Instancing with ANGLE\_ extension to pass matrices as an array
[ ] More realistic explosion dynamics
[ ] On explode have a full screen white rect appear immediately and fade out to transparency
[ ] Rats jumping around the logo in a circle (Rotating around as time passes)
[ ] Add back sprites/flies with some flocking
[ ] Better cheese texture mapping

# Bugs
[x] Fix z-fighting on cheese sign
